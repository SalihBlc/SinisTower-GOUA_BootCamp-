* **Sprint Review:** Our game idea was decided and accepted by the whole team. Logo and icon work has been completed.We have started working on an early prototype of the game. We created the basics using the objects provided by Unity and designed a prototype level. Items such as platforms, enemies, spawn points, and paths have been coded.Shooting, tracking and hitscan logic behind the turrets is written, and their interaction with the enemies was optimized. An Audio Manager logic was created & implemented into the prototype scene with the Game Master object. In the next sprint, we will focus on the concept story idea, continue coding, and design the level with the assets on the stage.
