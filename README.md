Immerse yourself in a visually stunning medieval world with a twist, where you get to embrace your inner villain and leave your mark in this compelling tower defense adventure.
## Product Features

* Allows players to upgrade their towers over time to increase their power, range, or add special abilities. Customization options include visual upgrades for towers.
* Introduces various types of enemies with different strengths, weaknesses, and behaviors. Some enemies may have high health, while others may be fast or have special abilities, requiring the player to employ different tactics.
* Creates a variety of levels with different terrains, paths, and obstacles. This adds complexity and strategic depth to the game, as players need to consider optimal tower placement and path manipulation.
* Implements a resource system that allows players to earn currency or points by defeating enemies. These resources can be used to build or upgrade towers, unlocking new defensive options as the game progresses.

* **Sprint Review:** The whole team decided on and accepted our game idea. Logo and icon work has been completed. We have started working on an early prototype of the game. We created the basics using the objects provided by Unity and designed a prototype level. Items such as platforms, enemies, spawn points, and paths have been coded. Shooting, tracking and hitscan logic behind the turrets is written, and their interaction with the enemies was optimized. An Audio Manager logic was created & implemented into the prototype scene with the Game Master object. In the next sprint, we will focus on the concept story idea, continue coding, and design the level with the assets on the stage.
* **Sprint Retrospective:** The first meeting with the team resulted in a decision to meet during the earlier hours of the day (optimal). However, based on feedback received from team members in the following days (and their availabilities), the meeting time was adjusted to rather late hour intervals. As a result of this change in decision, the productivity of the team members and the efficiency of our meetings showed positive improvements.

* **Sprint Notes:** In this sprint, we both focused on completing the gameplay aspect and the general art decisions of the game.

* **Sprint Review:** In this sprint, we built on the main components of the game and decided on the important dynamics. In-game economics logic has been established. Later we coded every essential part. In general; turret types, store properties, upgrade-sell-buy mechanics, camera movements, in-game and out-of-game UI design changes, and the player's health bar design were the main focus of this sprint. Initial Tile Texture and possible path designs were created. Art Direction decisions were made as a team.
* **Sprint Retrospective:** All of the daily conversations continued over Whatsapp. Communication was well-maintained. Everyone was present at every meeting on time. Team dynamics were right on track without a problem. All of the team members worked together to avoid problems in the Push/Pull sessions of Unity.

* **Sprint Review:** This last sprint, we successfully executed all the planned tasks for the project. The design of the entire project underwent a significant rework, and each map was completed with the new art style in mind. Technical components for each map were utilized and finalized. We worked on the soundtracks and sound effects. The UI design of the game was completed. The enemy animations and varieties were added to the final product at last.
* **Sprint Retrospective:**  All of the daily conversations continued over WhatsApp alongside Discord. Knowing this was the last sprint, we continued to maintain well-maintained communication and cooperation. Respectful feedback was given when asked. We were extra careful about the Push/Pull sessions of Unity to avoid conflicts so we worked in harmony.
